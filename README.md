Lifecycle Cells
===============

An Android library that provides a *[Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/lifecycle/Lifecycle)* to any *[ViewHolder](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.ViewHolder)* through the implementation of the *[LifecycleOwner](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/lifecycle/LifecycleOwner)* interface, allowing it to interact with a *[Lifecycle-Aware Component](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle#implementing-lco)*.

## Motivation
During the *Google I/O 2017*, a new set of libraries where introduced under the name of *[Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/)*.
Among those various libraries, one of the most remarkables was the introduction of *[LiveData](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/lifecycle/LiveData)*, an observable data holder class.
In order to be able to observe it, a class implementing the *LifecycleOwner* interface must be provided.

*Google* just provided this functionality to *Fragments* and *Activities* out of the box since *Support Library 26.1.0*.

This library pretends to provide *ViewHolder* with these capabilities, giving to each *[RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView)*'s item its own *Lifecycle* and gaining all the advantages of being able to interact with any *Lifecycle-Aware Component*.

## Download
```groovy
dependencies {
    //...
    implementation 'dev.sarquella.lifecyclecells:lifecyclecells:1.0.2'
}
```

## Sample Project
A basic [sample](https://github.com/Sarquella/LifecycleCells/tree/master/app) is given to demonstrate how the provided *ViewHolder*'s *Lifecycle* can be used to interact with a *Lifecycle-Aware Component* such as a *LiveData* instance.

## Usage
The library is composed by 3 main abstract classes:

* **LifecycleViewHolder**: A simple abstract *ViewHolder* subclass that just implements the *LifecycleOwner* interface, with the methods to update its *LifeCycle* when necessary.

* **LifecycleAdapter**: A simple abstract *[Adapter](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.Adapter)* subclass that is in charge of calling the corresponding `LifecycleViewHolder` methods for updating its *LifeCycle* when needed.

* **LifecyclePagedListAdapter**: Works the same way as `LifecycleAdapter`, but it subclasses *[PagedListAdapter](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/paging/PagedListAdapter)* in order to be compatible with the *[Paging Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/)*.

### Usage Steps
1. Make your *ViewHolder* extend `LifecycleViewHolder`:
  
	```kotlin
	class MyViewHolder(itemView: View) : LifecycleViewHolder(itemView) {
		//...
	} 
	```

2. Make your *Adapter* extend `LifecycleAdapter`:

	```kotlin
	class MyAdapter : LifecycleAdapter<MyViewHolder>() {
		//...
	}
	```

3. **Congratulations!** üôå Your *ViewHolder* is now a *LifecycleOwner* üòã

<br>

**NOTE:** If you want to use the **_Paging Library_**, make your *Adapter* extend `LifecyclePagedListAdapter` instead:

```kotlin
class MyPagedListAdapter : LifecyclePagedListAdapter<MyListType, MyViewHolder>(DIFF_CALLBACK) {
	//...
}
```
<br>

### Using a custom Adapter (Less Recommended)
If you are already extending any other custom *Adapter* and can not make it extend `LifecycleAdapter` nor `LifecyclePagedListAdapter`, you can still make it compatible with `LifecycleViewHolder` by overriding the following *Adapter*'s methods:

* **onViewAttachedToWindow**
* **onViewDetachedFromWindow**
* **onViewRecycled**

Override them as follows:

```kotlin
class MyAdapter : AnyCustomAdapter<MyViewHolder>() {

	override fun onViewAttachedToWindow(holder: MyViewHolder) {
		super.onViewAttachedToWindow(holder)
        
		//Notifies LifecycleViewHolder it has been attached
		holder.onAttached() 
	}

	override fun onViewDetachedFromWindow(holder: MyViewHolder) {
		super.onViewDetachedFromWindow(holder)
        
		//Notifies LifecycleViewHolder it has been detached
		holder.onDetached()
	}

	override fun onViewRecycled(holder: MyViewHolder) {
		super.onViewRecycled(holder)
        
		//Notifies LifecycleViewHolder it has been recycled
		holder.onRecycled()
	}
    
	//...
}
```

## Observing LiveData
There is no doubt that one of the main purposes for providing a *Lifecycle* to the *ViewHolder* class is to be able to use it for observing a *LiveData* instance.

In order to do so, we first need to obtain the *LiveData* instance.
There are several ways of obtaining it and may vary on each situation. However, for most common cases, the recommended way is by obtaining it following the *Google*'s proposed **_MVVM_** pattern. This way, the *LiveData* instance will be provided by the *[ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)*.

Please, refer to this [*StackOverflow* question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47453261/android-architecture-components-using-viewmodel-for-recyclerview-items) to find out how to use a *ViewModel* with a *ViewHolder*.

Finally, just get the *LiveData* instance through the *ViewModel* to observe it from the *ViewHolder* extending from `LifecycleViewHolder`:

```kotlin
class MyViewHolder(itemView: View) : LifecycleViewHolder(itemView) {
	//...
	fun observeLiveData() {
	    viewModel.liveDataInstance.observe(this, Observer {
	      //...
	    })
	}
	//...
} 
```
